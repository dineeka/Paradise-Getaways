	<h1 style="margin-top:80px;"> Kandy </h1>
	<p>Kandy is a large city in central Sri Lanka. It's set on a plateau surrounded by mountains, which are home to tea plantations and biodiverse rainforest.
	The city's heart is scenic Kandy Lake (Bogambara Lake), which is popular for strolling. Kandy is famed for sacred Buddhist sites, including the Temple of
	the Tooth (Sri Dalada Maligawa) shrine, celebrated with the grand Esala Perahera annual procession.</p>
	
	<h2> What are the best things to do in Kandy ? </h2>
	<h3> Temple of Sacred Tooth Relic, Kandy</h3>
	<img src = "../images/toothrelic.jpg" alt ="pic of the sacred temple of tooth relic" height="300" class="Kandyimg">
	<p>This ornate golden-roofed temple houses the most important Buddhist relic in Sri Lanka - a tooth of Buddha brought to the island in the 4th century. 
		The temple was built between 1867 and 1707 specifically to honour this sacred relic, and the temple has long since been a place of importance for 
		both Sri Lankan and international visitors. </p>
		
	<h3> Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya</h3>
	<img src="../images/BotanicalGarden.jpg" alt = "A picture of the botanical garden" width= "500" height="300" class="Kandyimg">
	<p>If these gardens feel insanely grand, it’s because they were formerly reserved exclusively for Kandyan royals to stroll through before they were 
	transformed into the Botanic Gardens in1821 at the behest of the ruling British.
	Today, even measly commoners like us are allowed to wander the grounds, which are now home to over 10,000 trees spread across 60 hectares.
	The gardens also showcase all of Sri  Lanka’s unique flora along with representative species from all around the tropical world. </p>
	
	<h3>Three - Historic Temple Loop of Kandy </h3>
	<p>The three temples, Gadaladeniya Viharaya, Ambakke, and Lankathilaka form the aptly named 'three temple loop', and serve as a living history 
	to Sri Lanka's extensive Buddhist heritage and craftsmanship.  </p>
	
	<h3> Gadaladeniyia Temple</h3>
	<img src = "../images/Gadaladeniya.jpg" alt = " A picture of the temple Gadaladeniya" height="300" class="Kandyimg">
	<h3>Ambakke Devalaya </h3>

	<h3>Bahirawakanda Vihara Buddha Statue</h3>
	<img src="../images/bahirawakanda-mob.jpg" alt = "A picture of the Buddha statue" height="300" class="Kandyimg">
	<p> The beautiful Bahirawakanda buddha statue sits atop Bahirawa Kanda hill as if overseeing the daily life of Kandyans below. 
	Bahirawakanda offers incredible panoramic views over the green and blue hues of Kandy and beyond and is best to visit at sunset
	when the city is bathed in a golden glow as the sun drops behind the mountains in the distance. </p>
	
	<h3>Udawatta Kele Sanctuary</h3>
	<img src="../images/udawattakele-forest.jpg" alt = "A picture of Udawattakele Forest" height="300" class="Kandyimg">

	reptiles, and other animals. There's a hiking path within the sanctuary, which is about a 5km round trip. </p>
	<h3>The Kandy Lake</h3>
	<img src="../images/Lake.jpg" alt = "A picture of the kandy lake" style = "width: 500;" height="300" class="Kandyimg">
	<p> Right at the heart of Kandy is the Kandy Lake; surprisingly peaceful despite the bustling road that winds around it, and 
	the backdrop to many of the city’s major attractions including the Temple of the Tooth Relic, and Udawattakele Forest reserve. 
	It takes about an hour to walk the lake’s circumference (just over 3kms) </p>
